# Tailwind CSS Not Working - No Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: the directives are not applied, and there are no error messages during the build process.  The project loads, but the Tailwind CSS styles are absent.

## Problem
The issue stems from an incorrect or missing configuration within your project's setup.  Tailwind CSS needs to be correctly integrated into your build pipeline.  This is usually done using a build tool such as Webpack, Vite, or Parcel.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is properly included and configured in your build process.  This typically involves:

1. **Installing Tailwind CSS:** Make sure you have Tailwind installed correctly using npm or yarn.
2. **Configuring PostCSS:** Ensure PostCSS is properly configured to process Tailwind's directives.
3. **Tailwind Configuration File:**  Verify that your `tailwind.config.js` file (or equivalent) is set up to point to your project's CSS files.
4. **Importing Tailwind CSS:** Properly import the Tailwind styles into your project's main CSS file or entry point.
5. **Adding the directives in your component:** Finally make sure you are using the directives correctly in the component.
